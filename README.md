# Monero/XMR r/place Bot
Fork from PlaceNL/placeDE bot. Thanks guys!  
The bot for our logo in r/place! This bot updates the saved pixels every few minutes, to avoid colliding bots.

## How to install

only start if you can currently place a pixel!

1. Install the browserextension [Tampermonkey](https://www.tampermonkey.net/) or [Violentmonkey (Firefox)](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/violentmonkey/).
2. Klicke auf diesen Link: [lnk](lnk). Tampermonkey or Voiletmonkey will open and ask you to install an userscript. Click install. 
3. Reload the **r/place** Tab. If you can see messages on the top right corner, the bot is working. He will give you updates on what he is doing there.

## Known bugs:

- Bot doesn't show a new cooldown message (has no impact on the placed pixels, just broken ui)
- bot fails to fetch cooldown (you will loose about 5 minutes)
